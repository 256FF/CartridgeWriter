Given that that Express is the base flavor of Visual Studio\r\nthis code should compile with any other flavor of Visual Studio 2013 that can compile\r\nc# desktop applications.  This has not been tested with any other versions of Visual\r\nStudio, but if anyone tries compiling with a different version let me know what\r\nhappens and I can post the results here.\r\n\r\n\t-Visual Studio 2013\r\n\t","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
